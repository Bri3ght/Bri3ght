# Welcome! ^_^

---- ABOUT ME

 i fictkin Thomas from HWWHP because i share most of qualities with him. also that's why i'm known as Thomas around my acquantances! [ i'm NOT comfortable sharing my real name. ] i also identify myself as genderfluid, with no real preferrence. you may stick to any pronouns what feel more right for you towards me! 

 i'm a person what likes socialising and making some new contacts, but it may be really hard for me to find that first spark. 
 
 mostly sitting in one location with someone i know, but C+H is encouraged, if i'm being alone at the moment! anyways feel free to talk to me [ if my nickname doesn't say otherwise! ], just know what i can be vague at first! nonetheless i still will be trying to stay friendly and willing to help, even if all i can do is to offer my presence and listening ear! ^_^

 despite myself trying to be polite and everything, i'm also easy to scare at first. as my DNI i can mark:
 + scary looking ponies (with big toothed mouths made of bandana item, for example),
 + ones who boop at the first sight. i dont really get it!... when i dont know you and suddenly you come out of nowhere to poke me - i get confused with implications behind your gesture and because of that nervous and uncomfortable. especially when you don't stop after i asked you to :( . you can ask me though, if you want to pat me that much!!
 + pedo*, zoo* and others alike + ones who would seek to make some romance with me - i'm not looking for anyone who would want more than a friendship with me. no, ty!...  *  - i do not support such.

 that's all ! i'm actually really friendly and willing to accomodate you. to be honest, you can call me a doormat.. ^_^"

 i have a flowering bouquet of personal problems in which i sometimes start to drown. what i say down is not even a half, but it's important. i don't ask you to feel sorry or pitying towards me, i'm just saying what my mental state isn't all flowers and rainbows.

---- SOME IMPORTANT THINGS I ADVISE TO READ BEFORE GETTING CLOSE WITH ME
- ! I HEAVILY CLING TO PEOPLE I LIKE AND CONSIDER FRIENDS ! - if you're not ready for that or dislike such, then please, tell me. i'm just dependent person what desperately tries to save any connection with others i liked. if you ever choose to leave me, just tell me, and i'll understand. i don't have problems with letting go when i know why person chose to abandon me. but if you don't tell me, i may start this clinging thing again. :(

- ! I DON'T UNDERSTAND ACTIONS ! - no matter how many times i tried, i came to acknowledge in the end, what i can't understand those. if youre offended, angry at me, if i did something wrong, please, tell me directly, or at least hint with words! because whenether you just block me i start to blame myself heavily, doubting all my said words and taken actions, even if you just ignored me because of being in bad mood. i'm an understanding person and shall you just say what you're not in the mood for chatting - its fine, i'll leave you alone. please, just communicate with me. i hate overthinking ^_^"

- ! I TEND TO OVERTHINK GREATLY ! - as i said in upper line, i have such problem. i sometimes can misundertand your actions and overthink because of that. i can't help it, i'm just starting to doubt and take the blame on myself, trying to understand what has happened, and usually from my experience - it irritates people. overthinking is wearing me down mentally really much!.. i'm sorry, be patient with me!

---- PONIES!!!

i like to show my mood though some of my ponies! this isn't a system, i just share how i feel at the moment by the pony i use!
main ones - 
- Thomas (HWWHP) - i'm feeling down or sad. don't let the face fool you.
- Skittles/Soren (HWWHP) - i'm irritated and/or angry at the moment. REALLY angry, i mean it.
- Gabriel (TMC) - neutral! if face is hidden - i'm not in the chat with anyone currently, a little closed off (but you still can talk to me though!). but if open means im ingaged in some dialog and open to talk! (i never sit with open if alone!) ^_^  
- Adam (TMC) - probably feeling tired and don't really want to chat at the moment.
- Shedletsky (FS) - feeling good and do want others to sit with me, no matter if we know each other or not!
- Mangosteen - i show what i seek comfort or already comfortable at the moment! though i'm not talkative when using this!!
- Harvey (BM) - practically being him with the people-pleasing thing. means i'm in a very good mood, all friendly and welcoming!

usually positive! - 
- Aventurine (HSR) - confidence
- Brieght (OC) - generally good!
- Lynn (KALPA) - just fine, almost neutral

usually negative - 
- Liche (OC) - just terrible.
- Cosmo (DW) - depends
- Affogato (CRK) - still talkable, a little

other ponies i use are hiding no certain and profound meaning as ones i noted here! the emotions there may be anything. the only thing what is not changing is IWEC factor. ^_^
